## TODO

### logs

-   [ ] gpu device
-   [ ] inputted flags (including threads used)
-   [ ] scaling to different pixel format (swsscaler)
-   [ ] fallback encoder
-   [ ] progress for decoer, processor, and encoder
-   [ ] mismatched/error frames count
-   [ ] time taken and fps
-   [ ] threads count

### flags

-   [x] performance modes (for different processor counts)
-   [x] input and output file
-   [x] scaling
-   [x] lanczos window size
-   [x] gpu device number
-   [ ] threshold level _(low priority)_

### features

-   [ ] threshold adapability _(low priority)_
-   [x] cli
-   [x] lanczos kernel multithread
-   [x] cubic interpolation
-   [x] lanczos resampling
