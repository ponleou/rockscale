-   [ ] scaling to different pixel format (swsscaler)
-   [ ] fallback encoder
-   [x] progress for decoer, processor, and encoder
-   [x] mismatched/error frames count
-   [x] time taken and fps
-   [x] threads count

### flags

-   [x] performance modes (for different processor counts)
-   [x] input and output file
-   [x] scaling
-   [x] lanczos window size
